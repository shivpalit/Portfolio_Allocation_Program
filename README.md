# Portfolio_Allocation_Program

This repository contains a Python class which allows the user to generate the optimal allocation of stocks based on the Sharpe ratio of a portfolio of stocks.

The Jupiter Notebook (Example.ipynb) in this repository provides an example of how the class can be used to produce the portfolio allocations.

Note: this is a work in progress and the file contains additional methods that are still being developed
